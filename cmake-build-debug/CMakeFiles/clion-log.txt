CMake Warning (dev) at /home/husky/.local/share/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/CLion/ch-0/213.5744.254/bin/cmake/linux/share/cmake-3.21/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (SDL) does
  not match the name of the calling package (SDL2).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  cmake/FindSDL2.cmake:198 (FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS)
  CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
